# Hi there 👋
### Main reason to come here is a small but interesting history:

I started coding when I came to 1st year in the [college](https://rkmvccrahara.org/). At that time I have a tablet to do little bit coding. This tablet had small memory somewhere between 32 GB. But it's OS took 16 GB and after somewhere between 20 GB it lags very. So I had to formet it often I lost my codes everytime. And it takes me a good amount of time to rethink the problem and program it. So to store it permanently I started GitHub. I am not a programmer but a enthusiastic of programming.
Thank you for reading. 
Below some problem I tried.

# Help

There is a good amount bugs and some kind of low efficiency in my programs. I am not a programmer as I have mentioned. 
My urge is that please fix the bugs and report me so that I can learn something new.

Thank you 😌❣️
